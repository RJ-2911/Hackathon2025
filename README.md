# HackathonPrep
Our prep time to Hackathon :)


Guys try to use a singular format for coding so its easier to use, and do indend stuff.
Whenever u make a change do it in a new branch then when u feel its good to go commit to the main brnch

we will use this during Hackathon as well so get used to GitHub and Git in general if u still haven't
