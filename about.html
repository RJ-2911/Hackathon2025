                <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are a market place that provides a platform for exchange of surplus food for hungry stomachs to feed. </br>
We are a dedicated charity focused on reducing food waste and alleviating hunger by connecting surplus food donors with those in need. 
</br>Our mission is to create a sustainable solution that addresses the dual challenges of food waste and food insecurity.</p>

<p>Hunger is more than a missing meal</p>

<p>OUR VISION:-</p>

<p>Simple really, beat global hunger and bring out the best of humanity using food as a medium.
The idea is to create self-sustained chapters across the world who will look after their local community. And in the process, inspire people around us to give back to those who need it most.</p>
